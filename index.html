                    <p> A long time ago, my mother and father met while they were living in the Philippines. My mom was from Manila, while my dad was from the mountains, Baquio City. How they met I am not sure, but I do know that it was love at first sight. After getting to know each other and marrying, my father decided to enroll into the US Navy where he ended up being stationed in the Navy Base in Hawaii. Soon after, my mom, my aunt and grandma moved to Honolulu, Hawaii to start a new life in the US.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As time went by, my mom and dad made my family. I am the second youngest out of 7 sisters. Yes, 7. They tried hard for a boy but alas, it was not meant to be.
