                  <p>A long time ago, my mother and father met while they were living in the Philippines. My mom was from Manila, while my dad was from the mountains, Baquio City. How they met I am not sure, but I do know that it was love at first sight. After getting to know each other and marrying, my father decided to enroll into the US Navy where he ended up being stationed in the Navy Base in Hawaii. Soon after, my mom, my aunt and grandma moved to Honolulu, Hawaii to start a new life in the US.</p>

                  <p>As time went by, my mom and dad made my family. I am the second youngest out of 7 sisters. Yes, 7. They tried hard for a boy but alas, it was not meant to be. After my dad passed away, my mom met my step dad! He was in the AIRFORCE and was going to be stationed in Washington so he took all of us to the mainland where we have resided ever since. We are all grown up and living different lives but we always have time to visit each other.

                  <p>Video games have been a huge part of my life since I was a kid. I remember long nights with my sisters playing video games and we had such a great time. So everytime I play video games, it brings me joy like it does for everyone else.
