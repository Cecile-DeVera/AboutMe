                  <p><font face="verdana">A long time ago, my mother and father met while they were living in the Philippines. My mom was from Manila, while my dad was from the mountains, Baquio City. How they met I am not sure, but I do know that it was love at first sight. After getting to know each other and marrying, my father decided to enroll into the US Navy where he ended up being stationed in the Navy Base in Hawaii. Soon after, my mom, my aunt and grandma moved to Honolulu, Hawaii to start a new life in the US.</p>

                  <p>As time went by, my mom and dad made my family. I am the second youngest out of 7 sisters. Yes, 7. They tried hard for a boy but alas, it was not meant to be. After my dad passed away, my mom met my step dad! He was in the AIRFORCE and was going to be stationed in Washington so he took all of us to the mainland where we have resided ever since. We are all grown up and living different lives but we always have time to visit each other.</p></font>

                    <p>Video games have been a huge part of my life since I was a kid. I remember long nights with my sisters playing video games and we had such a great time. So everytime I play video games, it brings me joy like it does for everyone else. But along with training my mind, I love training my body! I love going to the gym 4 times a week doing some strength training! Sharp body, sharp mind.</p>
                    <p>When I am not at the gym or playing video games at home, I like to be out and about! My family and I love to travel every chance that we get. Las Vegas, Hawaii, and Canada are our favorite places to go! Last but not least, <strong>I love food!!</strong>Whenever I have time and money, I like to go and explore around Seattle and try different resturants, cafes, diners, and bars. Sometimes I am disappointed but most of the time, I find out I like things I have never even heard of! Expanding your knowledge of all things, including food, I feel are very important to being a well-rounded individual.</p></font>

                    <div class="a"><p><font face="verdana">Growing up, I thought I knew what I wanted. Started out my freshman year in college doing computer science, ended up not liking it as it was too complex for me. Next up, I tried to become a veternarian and tried out for the police academy. Unfortunately, I found out that I could not handle blood or the intense conditions when it comes to children and animals. I love them too much to see anything bad happen to them. After that, I went for my B.A. for business marketing and got 2 culinary degrees in Banquet and Catering and resturant production due to the fact I love food and that I want to own a business in the future.</p></div>
                      
                    <p>After taking a break from school and becoming bored with retail, I wanted to do something more hands on, which my sister then introduced me to Epicodus. And <em>WHOO-WEE!</em> I haven't been this challenged in a long time! I absolutely love the thrill of a great challenge! The feeling of making something and having it actually work gives me a sense of satisfaction. With the guide of Epicodus, I hope to elevate my passion for programming to higher goals and start a long lasting career in the Technological world! </p></font>
